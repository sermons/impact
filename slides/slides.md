[1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:6-7 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>

  + nor shallow, rocky soil without perseverance

8 For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, 


+ Type/example for believers:
  + Word of the Lord resounds outward
  + Faith toward God goes outward

#### ii. Work of God (9-10)
+ reception: inroad
+ Turned from Idols
+ Serve the Living+True God
+ Await Jesus
+ Q: whose faith has impacted me? 
  + Does my faith impact others? 
+ not just inviting to church
  + or doing acts of charity
+ but let Word of God sound forth
  + and our faith in God go out


but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.
