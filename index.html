# The Impact of Faith
## 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10

>>>
+ Thessalonika: capital of Macedon province
  + wealthy port on Aegean, ix 2 major trade routes
+ Ac17: Paul only there 3wks: Philippi - Thess - Berea
+ Though **Jews** of Thess stronger oppos than in Berea, but
  + **Believers** in Thess (mostly Gentile) became example to all Mac+Ach
+ 1Thes **encouragement**, very little **rebuke** (cf Cor, Gal!)
  + **thankful** as remember you
  + you **know**, don't need anyone to **remind** you, **continue** doing
+ We need encouragement to be **specific**:
  + "Encourage you: you're **cute**!" arrghh...
  + bc **good** person and **mean** well? kinda vague
+ How we **heard** gospel + **responded** to it

---
## Impact of Faith (1Thes1)
1. Work (v2-3)
1. Calling (v4-5)
1. Example (v6-10)

---
We give **thanks** to God always for all of you,<br>
constantly mentioning you in our **prayers**, <br>
[3](# "ref")
**remembering** before our God and Father 

your work of **faith** and labor of **love** <br>
and steadfastness of **hope** <br>
in our Lord Jesus Christ. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:2-3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ faith - hope - love

---
So now **faith**, **hope**, and **love** abide, these three;<br>
but the greatest of these is **love**.

[1 Corinthians 13:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
## 1 Thessalonians
### Growing Together, Even When Apart
+ 1: Impact of **Faith** (Thes)
+ 2a+b: Toil of **Love** (Paul)
+ 3: Strength from **Hope** (Tim's report)
+ 4: Growing in Purity + **Love**
+ 5a: **Hope** of Salvation
+ 5b: Acts of **Faith**

>>>
+ 1-3 thanksgiving, 4-5 instruction

---
**remembering** before our God and Father <br>
your work of **faith**

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ work: productivity, accomplish, output
+ faith: not strength of conviction
  + but trust in God's promises
  + builders build in vain
+ pandemic WFH: tired but don't feel productive? 

---
and labor of **love** 

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ hard work, labour, difficulty
+ not from external motivation: obligation, fear of punish, as transaction for reward
+ but internally motivated by love: 
  + see others as worthy of acts of service
  + for sake of sharing God's love
+ serve God bc have to or get to? 

---
and steadfastness of **hope** <br>
in our Lord Jesus Christ. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ persevere: remain/endure under pressure / stress
+ to hold course God set
  + not stubbornness / selfishness for own goal
+ bc assurance of eternal, living hope
+ what hope helps me persevere? 

---
## (outline 2)

---
For we know, brothers loved by God, <br>
that he has **chosen** you, 
[5](# "ref")
because <br>
our **gospel** came to you not only in **word**, 

but also in **power** and in the **Holy Spirit** <br>
and with **full conviction**. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:4-5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ election, select, chosen out and for a purpose
+ Gospel came with:
  + power
  + HS
  + much bearing-fullness
+ power of HS as confirmation of renewal: Ac10:44-46a
+ not spectacle nor emotion, but
  + boldness + honesty to proclaim Christ's glory
  + humility to recv forgiveness + to forgive
+ have i seen HS's power with preaching of gospel? 

---
## (outline 3)

---
You know what **kind** of men we proved <br>
to be among you for your sake. 

[6](# "ref")
And you became **imitators** of us <br>
and of the Lord, 

[1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ kind: what sort, how
  + proved: just "became"
  + not specifically actions, words, special effort
  + but how we live: person, character, habits
+ imitators: emulate, mimic, positive admiration
  + not only of Paul, but the Lord
+ in both Word and Works:
  + how received + proclaimed Word of God
  + testimony of God's Work in changing us

---
for you **received** the word in much **affliction**, <br>
with the **joy** of the Holy Spirit, 

[7](# "ref")
so that you became an **example** to all <br>
the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:6-7 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ part of how we impact others is how we **receive** Word of God:
+ **attitude** with which we listen (even now!)
+ **seed** does not bounce off **hardened** earth
  + nor shallow, rocky soil without perseverance
+ Example: **type**, strike, deliver a blow, impression
  + typical, prototype, archetype

---
For not only has the **word** of the Lord <br>
**sounded forth** from you <br>
in Macedonia and Achaia,

but your **faith** in God <br>
has **gone forth** everywhere, <br>
so that we need not say anything.

[1 Thessalonians 1:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Word of the Lord resounds outward
+ Faith toward God goes outward

---
For they themselves report concerning us <br>
the kind of **reception** we had among you, 

and how you turned to God from **idols** <br>
to serve the **living** and **true** God, 

[1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 (ESV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

---
[10](# "ref")
and to **wait** for his Son from heaven, <br>
whom he raised from the dead, Jesus <br>
who **delivers** us from the wrath to come.

[1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 (ESV) (p.2/2)](# "ref")

>>>
+ reception: inroad
+ our faith journey:
  + Turned from Idols
  + Serve the Living+True God
  + Await Jesus
+ learn by example: WFH, son's desk next to mine:
  + when frustrated: "arrrgh!"
+ Q: whose faith has impacted me? 
  + Does my faith impact others? 
+ not just inviting to church
  + or doing acts of charity
+ but let Word of God sound forth
  + and our faith in God go out
