# The Impact of Faith
## 1 Thessalonians 1:2-10

>>>
+ **miss** you, want to hear what **God's** been doing in your life
  + even in pandemic -- or **especially** during pandemic!
+ but can be **hard** to think of specific examples, and
  + even harder to think of ways in which **we've** made diff to others
+ "I'm stuck at **home**, ... on **computer** a lot ..."
  + am I **doing** anything w/my life?

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# **How** do I make a **difference** in others' lives?

>>>
+ chose series on 1Thes to **encourage** you:
  + though **apart**, keep **growing** in Christ together
+ But we need encouragement to be **specific**:
  + "Keep up good work!" -- oh thx, what work?
  + "You're so **cute**!" -- arrghh...
  + "You're **good** person, **mean** well?" -- kinda vague
+ Encouragement from today's passage very specific:
  + so we know what successes to **thank** God for
  + and what **goals** we need to continue **pursuing**
+ How we **heard** gospel + **responded** to it

---
## (prayer)
>>>
+ Come to receive the **Word**: not Sean's word / wisdom
  + but Word of the **living** + true God
  + the Word which **pierces** our own souls
+ the Word which calls us to **behold the Lamb** of God

---
## (Thessalonika)
>>>
+ Thessalonika: prov. **capital** of Macedonia
  + **wealthy** port at ix of 2 major trade routes
+ Ac17: Paul only there **3wks**: Philippi - Thess - Berea
+ Though **Jews** of Thess stronger oppos than in Berea, but
  + **Believers** in Thess (most Gentile): example to all Mac+Ach
+ 1Thes **encouragement**, very little **rebuke** (cf Cor, Gal!)
  + **thankful** as remember you
  + you **know** / don't need anyone **remind** you / **continue**
+ Starts out (as often does) w/**thanksgiving** for Thess:

## Impact of Faith [(1Thes1)](# "ref")
1. Energy (v2-3)
1. Election (v4-5)
1. Example (v6-10)

>>>
1. Thanks God for **work** Thess have been doing
2. Expresses confid in God's **calling** of Thess
  + demonstrated by HS in power
3. Highlights **impact** Thess make on believers everywhere
  + through their journey of faith

---
We give **thanks** to God always for all of you,<br>
constantly mentioning you in our **prayers**, <br>
[3](# "ref")
**remembering** before our God and Father 

your work of **faith** and labor of **love** <br>
and steadfastness of **hope** <br>
in our Lord Jesus Christ. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:2-3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **remember** in prayers: when think of you, **thankful**
+ faith - hope - love: end of **1Cor13**

---
So now **faith**, **hope**, and **love** abide, these three;<br>
but the greatest of these is **love**.

[1 Corinthians 13:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ in fact, these three are echoed throughout 1Thess
+ form a rough **outline** for the series:

---
## 1 Thessalonians
### Growing Together, Even When Apart
+ 1: Impact of **Faith** (Thes)
+ 2a+b: Toil of **Love** (Paul)
+ 3: Strength from **Hope** (Tim's report)
+ 4: Growing in Purity + **Love**
+ 5a: **Hope** of Salvation
+ 5b: Acts of **Faith**

>>>
+ 1-3 thanksgiving, 4-5 instruction
+ in ch1, all 3 refer to some aspect of the Thess' **work**:

---
**remembering** before our God and Father <br>
your **work** of **faith**

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ work (energy): **productivity**, accomplish, output
+ faith: not strength of **our** conviction
  + but trust in **God's** promises
+ What's the **secret** to productivity?

---
Unless the Lord **builds** the house,<br>
those who build it **labor** in vain.

Unless the Lord **watches** over the city,<br>
the watchman stays **awake** in vain.

[Psalm 127:1 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ pandemic **WFH**: tired but don't feel productive? 
+ the **work** of the **faith**:
  + searching Scrip for God's **promises**
  + and **acting** accordingly

---
and **labor** of **love** 

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ labour (debilitating blow): **toil**, hard work, difficulty
+ e.g., son struggling to understand **2D rotations** in math:
  + "**why** should I learn math?": "to get a **job**..."
+ but really, work should not be bc **external** motivation: 
  + obligation, **fear** of punish, **transaction** for reward
+ but **internally** motivated by **love**: see others as 
  + **worthy** of acts of svc for sake of sharing **God's** love
+ **Math** is part of it! Dev useful **skills**: love in **action**
  + e.g., friend is **overwhelmed**: life spinning out of control
+ **Thoughts** + hugs are good, but so is more **practical** help:
  + "Yes, life is complicated: let's start w/what we **do** know,
  + "work from there to make sense of what we **don't** understand"

---
and **steadfastness** of **hope** <br>
in our Lord Jesus Christ. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **persevere**: remain/endure under
  + e.g., pressure / stress
  + stay the course
+ diff w/**stubbornness**: who sets the **goal**?
  + **my** goal I persevere in? that's just **selfishness**
  + **God's** reward for those who persevere in obeying?
+ He is **faithful**, so we have an eternal, living **hope**

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Is my **work** driven by **faith, hope, and love**?

>>>
+ Gain **productivity** from faith in God's promises
+ **Toil** for God's kingdom, motivated by God's love
+ **Persevere** in serving Him bc of assurance of **hope**

1. Energy (v2-3)
1. **Election** (v4-5)
1. Example (v6-10)

>>>
1. Paul **thanks** God, remembering Thess' **work** in faith
2. Expresses **confid** in God's **calling** of Thess:
  + assurance of their salvation

---
For we know, brothers loved by God, <br>
that he has **chosen** you, 
[5](# "ref")
because <br>
our **gospel** came to you not only in **word**, 

but also in **power** and in the **Holy Spirit** <br>
and with **full conviction**. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:4-5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ chosen: **election**, selected **out** and for a **purpose**
+ Gospel came with:
+ **power**: not just philosophical debate
+ **HS**: not gen by human conviction/emotion
+ much bearing-**fullness**: not about strength of convic/trust
  + but doing sth **completely**, not halfway:
  + **preach** whole gospel, not just comfort part
  + **believe** whole gospel, even hard passages
  + **obey** w/whole life, every area/rl
+ power of HS as **confirmation** of renewal: Ac10

---
While **Peter** was still saying these things, <br>
the **Holy Spirit** fell on all who **heard** the word. 

[Acts 10:44-46 (ESV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

---
[45](# "ref")
And the **believers** <br>
from among the circumcised <br>
who had come with Peter were **amazed**,

because the **gift** of the Holy Spirit <br>
was poured out even on the **Gentiles**. 

[Acts 10:44-46 (ESV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

---
[46](# "ref")
For they were hearing them <br>
speaking in **tongues** and **extolling** God. 

[Acts 10:44-46 (ESV) (p.3/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ don't be thrown by the **tongues**:
  + **intelligible**, human languages
  + proclaiming the **gospel** + **praise** of God
+ extol: make **great**, declare greatness
+ purpose is not **spectacle** nor indulging emotion, but
  + **boldness** + authenticity in proclaim Christ's **glory**
+ I **know** Christ has chosen to **rescue** me --
  + and I know I have chosen to **turn** from my own way
  + and to **follow** Him!
+ So Peter says: we've got to **baptise** these folks!
  + HS is **assurance** of God's **calling**

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Have I experienced the **Holy Spirit's** power as the gospel is proclaimed?

>>>
+ Whether I'm the **hearer** or the **proclaimer**
+ humility to recv **forgiveness** + to **forgive**

## Impact of Faith [(1Thes1)](# "ref")
1. Energy (v2-3)
1. Election (v4-5)
1. **Example** (v6-10)

>>>
1. Energy: **work** we do serving God motiv by **FHL**
1. Election: God **chose** us as His own; we know by **HS**
1. Example: we follow **others** in how rcv Word of God
  + and our **journey of faith** sets example for others

---
You know what **kind** of men we proved <br>
to be among you for your sake. 

[6](# "ref")
And you became **imitators** of us <br>
and of the Lord, 

[1 Thessalonians 1:5-6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ kind: what sort, **how** ("proved": simply "became")
  + not specifically actions, words, or **special** effort
  + but how we **live**: person, character, habits
+ imitators (mimic): **emulate**, positive admiration
  + not only of Paul, but the **Lord**
+ in both **Word** and **Works**:
  + how received + proclaimed Word of God
  + testimony of God's Work as He causes us to grow

---
for you **received** the word in much **affliction**, <br>
with the **joy** of the Holy Spirit, 

[7](# "ref")
so that you became an **example** to all <br>
the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

[1 Thessalonians 1:6-7 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ part of how we **impact** others is how we **receive** Word:
+ **attitude** with which we listen (even now!)
  + **seed** does not bounce off **hardened** earth
+ rcv w/**obedience**, knowing may endure **suffering** for it
  + suffer not w/**bitterness** of soul, but **joy** of HS
+ Example (**type**): strike, deliver a blow, impact
  + made an **impression** w/how we **hear** the Word of God
+ and how it **echoes** out from us:

---
For not only has the **word** of the Lord <br>
**sounded forth** from you <br>
in Macedonia and Achaia,

but your **faith** in God <br>
has **gone forth** everywhere, <br>
so that we need not say anything.

[1 Thessalonians 1:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Word** of the Lord resounds outward (echo)
+ **Faith** toward God goes outward

---
For they themselves report concerning us <br>
the kind of **reception** we had among you, 

and how you turned to God from **idols** <br>
to serve the **living** and **true** God, 

[1 Thessalonians 1:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
and to **wait** for his Son from heaven, <br>
whom he raised from the dead, Jesus <br>
who **delivers** us from the wrath to come.

[1 Thessalonians 1:10 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ faith **journey**:
  + Turned from **Idols** (past)
  + Serve the **Living** + True God (present)
  + **Await** Jesus (future)
+ Past: idol: anything we **cherish** / pursue more than we do God
  + seeking others' **approval**: "tell me I'm a good person!"
  + science, human **intellect**: "if not observable, then not true"
  + **perfection** in others, rl, or even self:
    + "don't you dare insinuate anything bad 
    + "about my kid / marriage / parents"

---
>>>
+ Present: serve **living** + **true** God:
  + God is source of **life** + gives us renewed life
  + His Word is **truth**: guides us in wisdom
  + so we commit to a **servant's** life in obedience
+ Future: Jesus resurrected, ascended, will **return**:
  + so we **wait**: not just any waiting, unique word in NT:
+ **rising** wait until completion: increasing eagerness
  + not **passive**, killing time
  + but in full **assurance** of hope, acting accordingly
+ How has our faith **journey** impacted others?

---
>>>
+ Learn by example: e.g., WFH, son's **desk** next to mine:
  + when **frustrated**: "arrrgh!"
+ You **already** make an impact, even just in daily life!
+ e.g., wife driving, **car battery** died: pushed mid parking lot
  + got **nasty** looks!  Son said, "so **humiliating**"
+ How do you **deal** with anger or disdain directed at you?
  + (folks working **retail** or CSR know!)
+ Pandemic reveal true **colours** as society: just **beneath** surface,
  + how **proud** + **resentful** + **fractured** we all are
+ To find **healing** + **hope** in the living + true God,
  + to **experience** forgiveness + **show** it to others:
+ it truly makes an **impact**!

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
## Whose **faith journey** <br> has impacted me? 
## How does **my** faith in Christ <br> impact **others**? 

>>>
+ Need not be **long-term** mentor: Paul w/Thess very **short** time!
  + but profound **impact**, and Thess in turn to whole **region**
+ Let **Word** of God resound outward
  + and let our **works** of faith in God go outward
______
+ Your **Word** never returns to you in **vain**
+ We've **rcvd** it in hearts: came w/**power**, HS, abund fullness
+ Equip us to **accomplish** much in faith, **toil** out of love,
  + **persevere** bc living hope in You
+ As we **imitate** You and those who have shared the Word w/us,

+ May others see our faith **journey**: past, present, future
